				<h1>How to read</h1>
				<p>Something that people often seem to have trouble doing is reading an article and actually learning something from it. Here are a few tips for doing that:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Understand</b>: You will probably get more out of an article if you understand rather than memorise what is being said.</li>
					<li><b>Think</b>: If you see something that insprires you or provokes thought, take the time to deviaite from reading the text and work things out on your own.</li>
					<li><b>Simplify</b>: Break things down into simple parts to understand them, then put them back together to understand the whole concept.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>I probably could have written an entire article on this, but really it's simple. Actually, most things are that way: simple, until some textbook author comes to obfuscate ideas with brick walls of text. If you really need more, search the Feynman Technique.</p>
				<p>TL;DR: Reading large articles and textbooks is just a matter of reverse engineering to find out the obvious.</p>
