# KnowledgeBase

This is a place where I store anything relating to explainations of topics.

Things discussed can be very general or very specific, it just depends.

## Markdown conversion

I am currently working to convert the website to markdown. Eventually, I think this will just be a collection of documents, rather than a website, since that is easier to maintain than HTML files.

## Index

### Computer graphics

The most documented subject in CS that's also the least documented.

* [Algorithms](graphics/algorithms.md)

### Mathematics

One of the things I really like to talk about.

* [Minkowski sums and differences](maths/minkowski.md)

### Miscellaneous

* [Development model](misc/development_model.md) (doesn't everyone hate it?)
* [List based programing language ideas](misc/listbased.md) (not LISP 2.0)
* [How to read dense documents](misc/reading.md) (results vary by person)
