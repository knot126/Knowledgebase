# Quick Run

**Quick Run** is an endless running game. It is similar to the endless runners seen on mobile, but it is different in a few ways - most notably is that it is not suited to mobile gameplay specifically, but rather it is suited for computer gameplay.

## Definitions

### Endless Runner

An ***Endless Runner*** is an automically running game, meaning that the player does not have to worry about going forward. Instead, they are worried about in which direction they should move in order to avoid obstacles or reach an end goal.

Usually, the player is limited to choosing between three to five "lanes" which they can run in. This is not enough lanes to be complex, but still enough to provide challange. Examples of games that follow this common methodology are games like *Minion Rush*, *Crash Bandicoot: On The Run*, *Subway Surfers*, *Temple Run* and a multitude of *Sonic* mobile games.

*Quick Run* is different. Instead of limiting the player into lanes, it allows the player to move side to side freely. This can be hard to do on mobile, but on desktop it's can just be based on how long one presses the arrow keys.

### On-Rails Game

An ***On-Rails*** game has the camera on a fixed, deterministic path that the player cannot change. The path the camera follows might be straight, or it might be made with complex curves, or it might have something in-between.

Often, these kinds of games are shooting or targeting games that require the player to shoot obstacles or enmies in their path. One of the best examples is *Smash Hit*, and more examples can be found [here](https://www.giantbomb.com/on-rails/3015-169/games/).

*Quick Run* is more of an endless runner, and the camera isn't completely fixed, but it is important to mention on-rails games since *Quick Run* takes some inspration from *Smash Hit*.

## Characters

While there is no story for this game, I think the characters should be dragons drawn sort of like Konqi or Croc (though I do know he's a crocadile.. :P ).
