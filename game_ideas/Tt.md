# Tails Tatics

*Note: This is probably the game I am most scared to talk about; I worry that maybe it's a bit too specific to the tiular character and might never be able to happen, but I will keep this around and write it down because maybe it will be helpful one day. Excuse that this document is written so badly; it's just a draft.*

A fan game, oh so? No, not really. **Tails Tatics** is a very weird adventure sandbox creation game featuring Tails - yes, the Sonic character. I should start by saying that I've never played a Sonic game, but I think a lot of their characters would make for great original games.

## Technical and Engine

The game features a fully scriptable engine that allows the creation of the game easily. Most assets are procedureally generated at runtime to keep the game size really small as well as allow for unique generation of some assets at runtime. The assets should be generated within 15 to 20 seconds on the lowest common denominator platform.

The game features full polygon-based creation and distruction as well as weapon mechanics, though the weapons and destruction are used with care in order to be properly balanced with creation and so do not need as much testing or focus as the creation portion.

## Gameplay

The game should feature many large worlds to explore, with many different things to find and do. The player will be able to destroy (as in: polygon breakage), create (as in: build structures) and use tools (there could be a tools upgrade or crafting system) in order to traverse the landscape, find new things and complete the given objective.

### Arcade Games

Available will be what are called *Arcade Games*. *Arcade Games* will let the player play other games within this game. Most of these games will be mostly unoriginal, being based on other games either in the series, by the company or in "popular" culture, some being obvious references to things, and some even being overzealous and extreme parodies. Other games might be more original in nature.

## Story

I imagine that there will be many midsize stories that might lead up to a somewhat larger story at the end.

## Ease of Development

The game should be *really, really, really* easy to develop new content for and have lots of content. It should support modding for fan-made content as well.
