# Teardown-like Open World Game

I have had the idea for a Teardown-like open world game for a while. It might have been from before Quick Run, but I do not remember. The codename is "Nectarine" for now.

**Nectarine** is a sandbox game. It's sort of like Minecraft in that way. It features full building and destruction, procedureal world generation, weather systems, crafting systems and more. The only real difference between them is that Nectarine is fully based on normal polygons.
