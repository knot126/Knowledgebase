If you have trouble doing is reading an article and learning from it, that probably isn't your fault. Text isn't an optimal medium for learning everything.

That being said, given an article the best thing you can do is to simplify and understand. Break things down into simple parts to understand them, then put them back together to understand the whole concept.

And that works about 95% of the time.
