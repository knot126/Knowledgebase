# Direct comparison test

If we have a series, $A$, that we know converges:

$$A = a_0 + a_1 + a_2 + \cdots$$

And we have a series $B$, where $a_n > b_n$, that we don't know about:

$$B = b_0 + b_1 + b_2 + \cdots$$

Then we can say that $B$ converges because $a_n > b_n$, so $B$ must converge.

Intuitively, the sum of numbers that are in $B$ must be less than the sum of the numbers in $A$ if every number in $B$ is less than the corresponding number in $A$. This means that the series can't go to $\infty$ since we have a boundary on it's value, therefore it must be convergent!
